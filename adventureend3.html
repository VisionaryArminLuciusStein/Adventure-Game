        <head>No. You couldn't possibly bear the guilt of knowing that you killed a poor, defenceless, sick old man. You turn around and start to leave the room, but you hear a faint cackle.</head>
            <p>"Kheheheheh."</p>
            <p>Before you have time to react, a web of tentacles come at you from behind, wrapping around your torso. The old man sucks your soul out of it's earthly vessel, and traps it in a prison of infinite pain and torture until the end of time.</p>
