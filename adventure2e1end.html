        <head>After years of war, you are now the supreme ruler of the world. All the nations of the world bow to you now. You begin to reminisce that fateful day, the one that led to your sovereignty. Why did you go to that hospital anyways?</head>
    
            <p>While you ponder upon this, a great being, greater than the Earth itself, approaches from the depths of space. Your immediate fear of it's presence reminds you of the answer to what you were wondering about. However, it's too late. The being swallows the Earth, and you along with it.</p>
    
            <p>You should've killed him while you had the chance.</p>
